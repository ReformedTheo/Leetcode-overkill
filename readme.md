# Overkilled LeetCode Challenges

A series of LeetCode challenges ranging from simple to hard, solved in the most "overkilled" way possible.

## Introduction

In this repository, I tackle various LeetCode challenges and approach them in a not-so-traditional way. Instead of aiming for the most efficient or concise solutions, I've opted to go for the most "overkilled" methods, showcasing unique and sometimes convoluted ways to solve these problems. It's all in good fun and for the sake of learning and experimentation!
